    ## CI is failing

    ### Some GitHub Actions checks show as failed but WONT block your PR

    We're currently testing new GitHub Actions workflows in "non-required" mode. This means:

    - The checks will run and you'll see the results, but failures won't prevent you from merging
    - We're using this period to observe how the workflows behave across real PRs before making them required
    - If you see a failure on one of these checks, you don't need to do anything

    Once we're confident the workflows are stable and useful, we'll switch them to required. If you notice consistent failures or strange behaviours on **required checks**, please report it in #domain-devex so we can investigate.

    ### My CI run is failing with retries after 30mins+ and eventually getting cancelled. What's going on?

    This is usually a memory issue with the test runner.

    **How to diagnose it on *self hosted runners*:**

    1. Check if your tests are hitting memory limits. You can find your runner's resource utilisation in Datadog by looking up the pod identifier (found in the first step of your job logs): [Datadog pod explorer](https://app.datadoghq.eu/orchestration/explorer/pod?query=kube_namespace%3Aactions-runner-system)
    2. Look for memory usage spiking over the limit—this causes tests to slow dramatically and eventually fail or get cancelled.
    3. You can also check test-level timing data in Datadog to see if specific tests are taking unusually long: [CI test runs dashboard](https://app.datadoghq.eu/ci/test/runs)

    **What to try:**

    - Rebase onto the latest main to pick up any recent fixes
    - If running locally, try restarting Docker/Podman
    - Check whether the same tests pass on main—if main is also broken, it's likely a regression that slipped through

    **If the problem persists:**

    Post in #domain-devex with a link to the failing run. Include the pod identifier from your job logs so we can check resource utilisation. We're actively monitoring for these issues and running full test suites on main after each commit to catch regressions early.
